# DailyFantasyNeuralNet
Simple net for class project on daily fantasy football.

Looking back at this from a few months later. The net was producing random results do to the complexity of the problem.
Further we did not have enough data to properly get this thing going as we would have liked. The nnet was really fun to
 produce, but is really the only salvage-able part from this school project.  
 
I would, however, like to revisit this problem domain in the future and give it another go. Though I may look into 
other sports at that point.
